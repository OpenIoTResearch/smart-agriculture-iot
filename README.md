# Affordable IoT-Based Smart Agriculture System for Small-Scale Farmers

## Project purpose
To design and implement an affordable, low-power IoT system that enables farmers to monitor soil and environmental conditions in real-time, and receive actionable insights on crop irrigation and management.

## Features
1. Soil Monitoring
    - Real-time soil moisture tracking
    - Alerts when soil is too dry or over-watered
2. Climate Monitoring
    - Temperature and humidity tracking using DHT11
    - Light intensity monitoring for crop growth conditions
3. Smart Irrigation Control
    - Automatic pump/valve activation when soil moisture is low
    - Manual override via mobile/web app
4. IoT Connectivity
    - ESP32/Arduino sends sensor data to the cloud (MQTT, Firebase, or ThingsBoard)
    - Farmers can view data on a mobile or web dashboard
5. Data Logging & Visualization
    - Store historical data for analysis (growth patterns, weather trends)
    - Simple graphs for farmers to understand
6. Battery-Powered & Affordable
    - Powered by rechargeable battery (with solar charging option in the future)
    - Low-cost, scalable solution for small-scale farmers
7. Open Source & Expandable
    - Open for contributions (e.g., adding fertilizer sensors, AI predictions)
    - Designed to integrate more sensors as needed
