# Contributing to Affordable IoT-Based Smart Agriculture System

First of all, thank you for considering contributing! üöÄ
We welcome developers, researchers, and IoT enthusiasts to help make this project better.
Here is a guide for contributors (code standards, bug reports, feature requests).

## ü§ù How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from developers, researchers, and IoT enthusiasts!  
Here are some ways you can get involved:

1. **Fork the Repository**  
   - Fork this project to your GitHub account.  
   - Clone your fork locally to start experimenting.  

2. **Pick an Issue or Suggest a Feature**  
   - Check the [Issues](../../issues) tab for tasks, bugs, or feature requests.  
   - Propose new ideas by opening an issue. 

3. **Create a Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-your-feature-name

4. **Make Your Changes**  
   - Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-new-sensor`).  
   - Write clean, well-documented code.  
   - Add/update documentation if needed (README, diagrams, comments).  

5. **Test Before Submitting**  
   - Test your code on real hardware (ESP32/Arduino + sensors).  
   - Ensure it does not break existing features.  

6. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**  
   - Push your branch and open a PR against the `main` branch.  
   - Clearly describe what you changed and why.
